Try also compile `bem.bat` into `bem.exe` file and save path to this in user's env variables.
Then you can call this command everywhere you want, just by typing `bem` in console.

You can also save path to `.bat` file in user's env variables but you will call `bem` command by typing its name with its extension:
`bem.bat`.
